## Introduction
This project focuses on using data science to address a key challenge in human resources: predicting when an employee is likely to leave the company. By analyzing employee data, I developed a model that helps identify those who may be at risk of leaving, helping a company to take proactive steps to retain valuable talent. This solution can help improve employee retention and overall company performance. 
### Python Model used:
- Logistic Regression
