## Introduction
This project focuses on using data science to address a key challenge in human resources. By analyzing employee data, I developed a model that helps **identify** those who may be at **risk of leaving**, helping a company to take proactive steps to retain valuable talent. This solution can help improve employee retention and overall company performance. 


## Problem Statement
This project addresses the problem by developing a data-driven solution to predict when an employee is likely to leave, enabling organizations to take timely actions to improve retention.


## Background
- Import libraries and datasets
- Visualize dataset
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Testing and Training dataset
- Train and evaluate Logistic Regression Classifier
- Train and evaluate Random Forest Classifier
- Train and evaluate Deep Learning Model


## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
- Deep Learning Model (DL)


## Data Sourcing
The dataset used in this project is a cleaned version of information extracted from human resources department. This processed data was prepared for building the predictive model.


## Data Transformation/Cleaning
The data was previously cleaned with a first ETL process, the only and last changes produced to it were:
1) To replace 'Attritition' and 'overtime' column with integers.
2) To remove unnecessary columns such as 'EmployeeCount', 'Over18' and 'Standardhours'.
3) To scale categorical features such as 'BusinessTravel', 'Department', 'EducationField', 'Gender', 'JobRole' and 'MaritalStatus'.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this step, the principal objective was to:
- To visualize correlations between all features to find some tends.
- To compare dependent value with less correlated independent value.
- To graph and understand other correlations in values.

## Data Modeling


## Conclusions and Recommendations
