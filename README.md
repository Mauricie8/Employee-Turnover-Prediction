### Introduction
This project focuses on using data science to address a key challenge in human resources. By analyzing employee data, I developed a model that helps identify those who may be at risk of leaving, helping a company to take proactive steps to retain valuable talent. This solution can help improve employee retention and overall company performance.

### Problem Statement
This project addresses the problem by developing a data-driven solution to predict when an employee is likely to leave, enabling organizations to take timely actions to improve retention.

---

### Background
- Import libraries and datasets
- Visualize dataset
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Testing and Training dataset
- Train and evaluate Logistic Regression Classifier
- Train and evaluate Random Forest Classifier
- Train and evaluate Deep Learning Model
---

### Models Used:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
- Deep Learning Model (DL)

---

### Data Sourcing
The dataset used in this project is a cleaned version of information extracted from human resources department. This processed data was prepared for building the predictive model.

---

### Data Transformation/Cleaning
The data was previously cleaned with a first ETL process, the only and last changes produced to it were:
1) Replace 'Attritition' and 'overtime' column with integers.
2) Remove unnecessary columns such as 'EmployeeCount', 'Over18' and 'Standardhours'.
3) Scale categorical features such as 'BusinessTravel', 'Department', 'EducationField', 'Gender', 'JobRole' and 'MaritalStatus'.
